PatternSearch
=============

Search Patterns given by the user in a very long string, searching for batches in C language

Actual Version: Only find the pattern in a strinf using KMP algorithm. If KMP does not match any results, 
so it calls the "Longest Common Substring" algorithm to find the maximum match of the pattern in the string
given and also it prints the position where it was found.
